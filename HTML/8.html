    <p>The universal selector provided by CSS helps in choosing any elements within the HTML page. It goes with a single element and uses the asterisk (i.e., "*") symbol used for denoting the selector as a universal selector. It is usually written as an asterisk followed by a selector. The * is used for selecting all elements. This asterisk also has the capability to select all elements that are inside another element</p>
